# Carbon Lite

Carbon Lite is a simple to use yet powerful blog theme. Give your blog a solid look with a simple layout, and bold type. 
Tweak your typography and layout settings directly in the customizer, pick a color scheme, and go publish something.

The theme is very simple to use and supports WordPress' core functionalities:
 - custom logo 
 - custom background
 - custom header
 - custom menu
 - featured images (post thumbnails)

There are three widget areas:
 - The main widget area is the blog sidebar. Without any widget in this sidebar, the blog will display as a single column layout.
 - The footer widget area allows you to display a few widgets in the footer. 
 - The menu widget area allows you to add widgets to the slide-in panel, just under the menu.

There are three menu slots
 - The main menu slot features your main menu, obviously. You can close the menu by clicking the close button, clicking outside of the menu or pressing the ESC key.
 - The main social menu allows you to add social link icons under your main menu. Just link to your profile on your favorite platforms, and just use the platform name as the link text to get the correct icon to properly display.
 - The footer social menu works in the same way.

Supported social icons (link text given): 
 - facebook
 - mail (to display an enveloppe icon)
 - github
 - google-plus	
 - instagram
 - linkedin
 - pinterest
 - skype
 - soundcloud
 - telegram
 - tumblr
 - twitter
 - vimeo
 - youtube

## The Customizer options

This theme doesn't include any options page. Everything is handled in the customizer. Go to front end of your site while logged in and click 'Customize' to see the available options.

Carbon Lite supports all standard customizer options, like 'Site Identity', 'Header Image', 'Background Image', but also features new sections like 'Typography' and 'Display and Layout'.

 - The 'Colors' section features a few different color schemes you can choose from for your site.
 - The 'Typography' section gives you control over the size of your body text, your headings and your icons.
 - The 'Display and Layout' section allows you to control the size of your content area, the position of your blog sidebar and what content you want to display on your blog listing page.
 
The Customizer is a wonderful tool, and this theme will in the future make much more extensive use of it.

## JetPack Compatibility

This theme supports JetPack's Portfolio and Testimonial Custom Content Types.

Just activate them in your JetPack settings, and everything should diplay fine on the front end.
